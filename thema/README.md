# [Awdev Soft UI Dashboard](https://www.awdev.my.id/thema/pages/dashboard.html)
 
 Most complex and innovative Dashboard Made by [Awdev Corporation](https://www.awdev.my.id/). Check our latest Free Bootstrap 5 Dashboard.

Designed for those who like bold elements and beautiful websites. Made of hundred of elements, designed blocks and fully coded pages, Soft UI Dashboard is ready to help you create stunning websites and webapps.

We created many examples for pages like Sign In, Profile and so on. Just choose between a Basic Design, an illustration or a cover and you are good to go!

**Fully Coded Elements**

Awdev Thema Soft UI Dashboard is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented.
This Free Bootstrap 5 Dashboard is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless,
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

# Sponsor this project

 
- GitHub Sponsors is one more way to contribute to open source: financially supporting the people who build and maintain it. Funding individuals helps them keep doing important work, expands opportunities to participate, and gives developers the recognition they deserve. Starting today, any GitHub user can sponsor an open source developer in the program.

- To jump start this new program and boost community funding, we’re also launching the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund. GitHub will match all contributions up to $5,000 during a developer’s first year in GitHub Sponsors.

# Contributing to The Open Source Way

We aim to make contributing to The Open Source Way a pleasant and enriching experience for all project participants, and we welcome contributions of all kinds.

## Getting started

### 1. Review outstanding issues

- Check [the list of outstanding issues](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid/issues) to identify something project needs and you'd like to offer.
- Alternatively, see one of the projects various [work boards](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid/projects) to get a sense of tasks-in-progress that could use your help.

### 2. Raise your hand

- Once you've found an issue you can help us address, join the conversation about it. Project maintainers and guidebook editors will want to know who's volunteering to add new material or assist with.

### 3. Start working

#### Editorial tasks

If you've selected an **editorial** task, you can start contributing immediately following these steps:

- Comment on the editorial issue you've selected, expressing your interest and indicating what you're thinking of writing about. If you're ready, propose an outline for your chapter. If you need more guidance on what should be in the outline, work with the project's [lead writer](https://github.com/shaunix) and any other interested contributors who've also left comments.
- Refer to the project [style guide](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid/blob/master/STYLE.adoc) (updated regularly) for pointersâ€”but don't let small details slow you down. An editor will help you polish your work before it's finished.
- Examine [the outline](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid/blob/master/OUTLINE.adoc) and identify or more chapters you are interested in writing (or co-writing!).
- Comment in the issue that corresponds to your chosen chapter, letting others working on the project know that you're interested in working on a particular chapter. Editorial leads will move the card for your chapter(s) between columns on the [editorial project board](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid/projects/1). Once you're ready for an editorial review, post another note in the same issue, and we'll work on moving your card along our editorial process.
- Examine [the chapter file](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid) that corresponds to the chapter you've identified. You may find some source or seed material someone has already contributed into that chapter. Feel free to use that material; build on it to start, fill out, or complete a chapter. Or simply use it inspiration if it doesn't fit your vision. You can also consult the [1.0 guide](https://theopensourceway.org/wiki) for similar inspiration.
- Fork the project repository and adding material on a topic of your choice to its respective chapter. Then submit a pull request outlining your changes so an editor can review what you've added and work with you to polish it.
- Alternatively, propose edits to a guidebook chapter directly in your browser. Select a file in [the project repository](https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid) by clicking on it. Locate and click the [pencil icon](https://octicons.github.com/icon/pencil/) at the top of every file in the repository. Make chages to the file in your browser, then submit that file for review.

## Suggesting a change via a GitHub pull request

You are welcome to make pull requests against this repo from your own fork.
Here is how we recommend you manage this:

### Forking and cloning the upstream repo

1. Go to https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid and click on the '''Fork''' button, and make a fork in your own repo.
Tip: modify the name to make it clear it is your fork and not the upstream original, e.g. `yourname-fork-reponame`
1. Go to your personal fork at https://github.com/you/forkname, click '''Code''' > Local > SSH, and click the copy icon to the right of the URL.
1. Open your command line session and clone your repo locally:
   - `git clone git@github.com:[you]/[you]-awdevmyid.git`
   - `cd [you]-awdevmyid`
1. Add the upstream repo so your clone can sync with upstream:
   - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:awdevmyid/awdevmyid.git`
1. Check your configuration to be like this:
```
git remote -vv
origin	git@github.com:[you]/[you]-awdevmyid.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:[you]/[you]-awdevmyid.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:awdevmyid/awdevmyid.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:awdevmyid/awdevmyid.git (push)
```
1. Confirm that you can sync with upstream:
```
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
Current branch main is up to date.
git branch
* main
```


### Making changes and pushing them to GitHub as a pull request (PR)

When you want to make a change, you will make the change in your clone and submit the change to the upstream as a pull request (PR).

We recommend you also work in a branch within your clone.
This is necessary if you want to work on more than one change intended for different PRs.
Also, you can more easily discern which change you are working on by checking which branch you are in.

```
git checkout -b [branchname]  ## e.g. you-copyedits-01
git branch
  main
* you-copyedits-01
```

This confirms you are working in the branch `you-copyedits-01` and are ready for 01 or more copyedit submissions.

### Creating the PR

When you are ready to push your changes from local to GitHub, you need to commit them and configure the push:

```
git add ./filenames
git commit -m "Short descriptive message"  ## Or open a text editor for multi-line messages
git push --set-upstream origin [branchname]
```

The output will look something like the below. Note the link include in the output for making a PR only makes the PR in your fork ''not'' in the upstream.

To make the PR in the upstream, visit https://github.com/awdevmyid/awdevmyid ; you may need to reload the page for the '''Compare & pull request''' button to appear.
